# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s 
hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four 
of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and 
the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design 
of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Purpose: 
##### To scrape the Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and titles
##### To update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and titles
##### To incorporate two additional Bootstrap 3 Components
